# Using external APIs
I've chosen Unsplash to get my head around external APIs. They've got some good documentation.
The idea behind this repo it to create an app where you can search for images by category and save them to a 'moodboard' for later use. A kind of design resource.

To do/ stretch options
- []  save images to database
- [] save category used to search, with image, to database
- [] create page to display all images
- [] add filter search for categories on display page
